            <p>
                Welcome to my corner of the web.<br>
                I build high-performance software systems, lead engineering teams, and architect scalable backend solutions that power real-world businesses.<br>
                From telecom to retail analytics, I’ve worked across domains where performance, reliability, and clean engineering matter most.

            <h2>👤 About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a software engineer turned engineering manager who still loves to get his hands dirty in code. My expertise lies in backend development with C++, Golang, and Linux, and I have a deep interest in systems that demand high performance, resilience, and efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, I’ve worked across global companies like Amdocs, IHS Markit, and Dunnhumby, contributing to large-scale platforms and infrastructure. Whether it's optimizing algorithms, building robust data pipelines, or mentoring engineers—I thrive where code meets strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe in leading with empathy, building with precision, and always staying curious.
